Hi, my name is Weili Deng. You could call me as Edwin instead. I am the student from module 4006CEM.

My first project in this module is a group work of programming a robot called mblock ranger. It was my first time working with a group of people. 

The pick of group members was kind of random. Since we sat on the same table, that it was! In the first impression, Ermis was affable. Ahmmed helped us build the robot immediately. Robert did not seem to show a positive emotion about this job. I nearly regard him as a slack but his excellent performance would prove I was wrong in the future. At the end, the final performance was great and our group showed a wonderful cooperation.

A pride I have done for the mbot was the Mario theme song, which would be played at the end of the robotâ€™s journey. I still remembered people applause in the class at the end of our final video playing Mario. 

Since the build in blocks inside the mblock did not accept semitones, I had to write C++ in Arduino program. The code was attached.

One thing worth to be highlighted was that I never know programmer should learn music theory!
